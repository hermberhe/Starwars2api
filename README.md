# Star Wars API Project

## Read Me

This README file provides information about the behavior and limitations of the application related to fetching data from an open-source API for films and characters.

### 1. API Data Retrieval Delay

When using this application, you may notice a delay in fetching data when clicking the "Film" button or the "Character" button. This delay is due to the time it takes to retrieve information from the external open-source API. Please be patient while waiting for the data to load.

### 2. Film and Character Data Retrieval

- **Film Button**: Clicking the "Film" button will trigger a request to the open-source API to fetch film-related data. As mentioned earlier, there might be a delay in getting the data.

- **Character Button**: Clicking the "Character" button will initiate a request to the open-source API to retrieve character-related data. Similar to the film data retrieval, it may take some time to receive the character data due to API response times.

### 3. Lack of Images

It's important to note that the open-source API used in this application does not provide images for films and characters. Therefore, images related to films and characters are not included in the application's interface for these two models.

### 4. Smooth Navigation to "Latest News + Features"

Clicking on "News + Features" in the application's navigation menu will smoothly scroll to the bottom of the page where you can find the latest news and features. This provides a user-friendly and convenient way to access the latest updates.

### 5. Links in "Latest News + Features" and Social Media in the Footer

All links within the "Latest News + Features" section and the social media links in the footer are functional and will take you to the respective external pages. Feel free to explore the latest news and connect with us on social media.

## 6. you can open the site using "HTTP-server" or through Live server
